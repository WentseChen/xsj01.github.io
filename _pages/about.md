I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Gerogia Tech. I am interested in robotics and machine learning. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I finished my M.S at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and B.S at Peking University. In summer 2020, I interned at Uber ATG on self-driving car research.
